\subsection{Detailed Description}
This struct maintains the state of an individual neuron.\+The neuron struct contains the parameters needed to maintain state in the neuron, along with references to output commands (dendrites). 

Each parameter contained within {\bfseries [Cassidy2013]} , {\bfseries [Preissl2012]} , {\bfseries [Amir2013]}\textquotesingle{}s models of Neuromporphic design that operate with the neuron are contained within this struct. Consider this struct a proto-\/object, just sans functions.
