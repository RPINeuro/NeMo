This is a dec.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$neuron\+\_\+model.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
This is a dec. 

of a function that allows for neurons to have different leak functions. At this point, the only function is a dummy one. The functions alter the neuron\textquotesingle{}s current voltage.
