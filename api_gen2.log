I treat `x^1^2' essentially like `x^1{}^2'.

! You can't use `macro parameter character #' in math mode.
l.57 #
              out += "\n"
Sorry, but I'm not programmed to handle this case;
I'll just pretend that you didn't ask for it.
If you're in the wrong mode, you might be able to
return to the right one by typing `I}' or `I$' or `I\par'.

! Undefined control sequence.
l.57 #        out += "\n
                        "
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

! Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text>

I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.
