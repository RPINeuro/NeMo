True North ROSS Simulation & Benchmark
--------------------------------------
This is the current version of the NeMo neuromorphic hardware simulation, running on top of ROSS. 
Currently it is under significant development.
Documentation will be available through the WIKI, 
[github web page](http://markplagge.github.io/tnt_benchmark/) and through the official web site for the project.

Since stand-alone documentation will not be complete for some time,
please check the doxygen generated code for information on the current status and structure of the model. 
 
Doxygen generated documentation can be found at [this location.](http://markplagge.github.io/tnt_benchmark/doc_html/index.html)
